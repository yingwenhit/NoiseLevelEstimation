*miniBatch* with for miniBatch experiments

NLE_image (experiments results)
html-* (same parameters test results, with explicit scheme and old version equation)
Other Methods NLE (compared method)

NLPM_Imp_NLE_test.m  (test experiments (paper use))
NLPM_Imp_NLE.m (NLPM-NLE with parameters)
NLPM_Imp_GS.m (NLPM implementation)
*NLPM_Imp.m (NLPM implementation with AOS algorithm (not good at ERROR and time))

*NLPM_NLE_C2_test.m (test experiments, Explicit Scheme, and equation old version (diffusion coefficient is all u not f))
*NLPM_NLE_C2.m (NLPM-NLE with parameters, explicit scheme with old version equation)

*NLPM_NLE_test_sameParameters.m (NLPM-NLE same parameters test, explicit scheme with old version equation)

imagaussian.m  (gaussian deblur)

*Imp_NLPM_GS.cpp ((1st version) apply Gauss-Seidel method to solve the semi-implicit scheme of NLPM equations)
Imp_NLPM_GS2.cpp ((2nd version) reduce the size of coefficient (from N*N to N*5))

*NLE.m very old version
